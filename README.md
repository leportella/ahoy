# Ahoy

This was my first big project ever made with Python.

This is a GUI interface to calculate ship infos accorind to its type and some other feature such as size, DWT (weight) or beam.

There are no tests, it can't run well on linux environment, but this reminds me how I fell for programming. I just wanted to have it saved somewhere.
